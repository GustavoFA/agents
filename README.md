## Project - TARS

This is a prototype of an intelligent voice agent capable of:

* Listening for a voice command.

* Transcribing the command using **Whisper**.

* Sending the command text to **Llama3** (local LLM - using Ollama).

* Receiving and responding both via text and synthesized voice (on development).

* Maintaining a conversation memory to preserve context across interactions.
